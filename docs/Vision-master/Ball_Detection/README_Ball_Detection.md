## Description:

Read_me is written to facilitate the understanding of the code.
The program finds the coordinates of the boundary of the Largest Circle in camera feed in the given hsv values and marks the boundary of the circle alongwith its centre.
There is a window named ‘trackbars’ to adjust the minimum and maximum hsv values and minimum radius.
Using opencv functions operations the largest circle contour is found after which the center and boundary is plotted on the ‘frame’ for the circle.
The coordinates are stored in ‘center’ which can be subscribed to a file.
Then all the relevant images are displayed.

  

```sh

kernal = np.ones((5,5), np.float32)/25
blurred = cv2.filter2D(frame, -1, kernal)
hsv = cv2.cvtColor(blurred, cv2.COLOR_BGR2HSV)

#blur the image and convert color coding to HSV.

```

```sh

HSV_MIN=np.array([h_min, s_min, v_min])
HSV_MAX=np.array([h_max, s_max, v_max])

#create arrays for storing minimum and maximum HSV values.

```

  

```sh

mask = cv2.erode(mask1, None, iterations=2)
mask = cv2.dilate(mask, None, iterations=2)

#reduce noise.

```

```sh

cnt = max(cnts, key=cv2.contourArea)

#find the region with maximum area.

```

```sh

((x, y), radius) = cv2.minEnclosingCircle(cnt)

#get center and radius of the smallest circle enclosing the ball.

```

  

```sh

if radius > r_min:

#check if ball is large enough.

```

  




  

```sh

cv2.circle(frame, (int(x), int(y)), int(radius), (0, 255, 255), 2)
cv2.circle(frame, center, 5, (0, 0, 255), -1)

#draw two circles: one showing boundary of the ball, other the center.

```
  
  

## Background

Line_follower was first written under the summer project of Humanoid club, IIT kanpur.

  

It was written by Mrinal Dogra to work with a small scale humanoid developed indigenously by the Club.

It worked perfectly at the time of final testing.

  

The code was updated by Madhur Deep Jain and Shashi Kant and is currently being moderated by Deepankur Kansal And Paras Mittal.

## Usage

Click on the file Circle_Detection.py to get the full code. 

## Shortcomings

1.The code depends on the color of the circle/ball.

2.If the image frame has some region other than the ball having the same color, and has a larger area, the code reports the center of that area.

  

3.Cannot detect balls/circles of different colors together.

  

4.Finds center of only one circle/ball.

  
5 Have to calibrate manually using trackbars.
